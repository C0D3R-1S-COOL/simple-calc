# It's very simple

Hello. This is my first repository, and I want this to go from a basic input program to a GUI calculator! I would like you to tell me how to improve it, so that you can steer me in the right direction. Please be nice, as I am relatively new to programming.

As of now, you can run it by going into a terminal, enter into `simple-calc`, and running it using `python3`
Here's how it should look in linux. (I'm not sure if this works in Windows.)
```
$ cd (what the repository's location is)
$ python3 simple-calc.py
```
