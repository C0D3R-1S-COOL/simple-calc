# It's very simple

Hello. This is my first repository, and I want this to go from a basic input program to a GUI calculator! I would like you to tell me how to improve it, so that you can steer me in the right direction. Please be nice, as I am relatively new to programming.

As of now, you can run it by going into a terminal, enter into the `simple-calc` folder, and running it using `python3`
Here's how it should look.
```
$ cd path/to/file
$ python3 simple-calc.py

Enter number 1: 10
Enter an operation (M - Multiplication, D - Division, A - Add, S - Subtract): D
Enter number 2: 3
3.3333333333333335
Do you want to reuse the last input in a new operation? (Y - Yes, N - No): Y
Enter an operation (M - Multiplication, D - Division, A - Add, S - Subtract): M 
Enter number 2: 6
20.0
Do you want to reuse the last input in a new operation? (Y - Yes, N - No): Y
Enter an operation (M - Multiplication, D - Division, A - Add, S - Subtract): D 
Enter number 2: 4
5.0
Do you want to reuse the last input in a new operation? (Y - Yes, N - No): N
```
All you need is python3 and access to any terminal to run this.
